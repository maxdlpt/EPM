# Equity Pricing Model (EPM)
Built during my internship at Quaero Capital, with the guidance of Bruno Allain, a senior equity portfolio manager.
### Valuation Methods in the Model:
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
- Relative Value (RV)
- Sum-Of-The-Parts (SOTP)

This model is most useful with access to a Bloomberg terminal but can also work without.

Only input into cells whose colours differ slightly from the rest.

The demo version is already filled in with an example.
